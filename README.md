A portfolio of **36 hands-on security projects plus a multi-cloud AI capstone**, built across a 20-week, depth-first program. Each project solves a real-world security problem and ships with an architecture diagram, step-by-step build, a verification checklist, and a "what I learned" writeup.

> **The README standard (applied to every project):** one-line purpose · architecture · controls mapped to CIS / OWASP / NIST · a STRIDE threat-model table · a 3-command quick start · a 2-5 min demo · "what I learned."
